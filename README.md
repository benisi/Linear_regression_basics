# Linear regression basics

This is a repo that contain the code i wrote while learning linear regression, it can be a good resource for learning because i will add a link to all the materials i used at the reference section. Contributions are welcome

## Formular

Remember the equation of a straight line? y = mx + c where y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable, m is the gradient and c is the interception at the y axis. This principle combine with the principle of best fit is used to calculate linear regression..
